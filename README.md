Set the Grid Size
Open the ‚öôÔ∏è Config panel and set the Size (e.g., 4 for a 4x4 nonogram), and cell size. 
In the future, cell size will automatically adjust for a 1920x1080 stream layout... but for now it should be done manually.

Click and drag the grid to place it over the nonogram puzzle shown on stream.

Marking Cells
