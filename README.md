The grid now auto-loads with buttons hanging off the right and bottom edges.

Drag & Position
Whenever the grid expands or shrinks, it always grows toward the top-left‚Äîso we‚Äôre anchoring it by the bottom-right corner.

How to Use

Set ‚ÄúGrid Size‚Äù to your puzzle dimensions (e.g. 5√ó5).

Enter your row- and column-clue lengths (row clues only matter on big grids with 8+ clues).

Hit Scale to get it roughly in place, then Fine-tune until it‚Äôs pixel-perfect.

Marking Cells

Left-click to fill (black); click again to clear.

Right-click to mark empty (white); click again to clear.

Exporting Your Progress

‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt double-click‚Äîeach export only grabs changes since the last one.

Extras

You can hide the Scale and Fine-tune buttons in the Config panel once you‚Äôre set.

There‚Äôs also Export/Import JSON for sharing full config presets.

üß† Happy nonogram solving!
